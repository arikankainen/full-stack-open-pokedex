For linting Python applications, we can use widely used tool pylint, that checks for errors, coding standards and potential issues in code. flake8 is another tool that combines several linting tools and focuses on code style enforcement. For testing, the easiest option might be the built-in testing framework named unittest. pytest is another popular testing framework that is known for its simplicity and powerful features. There are also tools like nose2 and tox that runs tests in multiple virtual environments to ensure cross-environment compatibility.

There are alternative CI tools like Travis CI that is a cloud-based service that integrates with GitHub repositories. CircleCI is another good cloud-based alternative. If we would use GitLab instead of GitHub, we could use GitLab CI/CD that is similar to GitHub Actions.

Cloud-based environment would be the most obvious choice for such a small team. Being a Python project, there is no need for computation expensive build processes, so the recources provided by cloud-based environment should be enough. Also, getting CI setup up and running is much simpler and faster with eg. GitHub Actions than creating own self-hosted environment. Especially for small teams, creating own self-hosted server and configuring it for CI can be too expensive. The price for cloud-based CI also depends a lot on how often and how big deployments the team will need.
